A temperature converter is a tool or device designed to convert temperatures from one unit of measurement to another. The most common temperature scales are Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). Depending on the application or region, people may use different temperature scales, and a temperature converter helps in easily converting values between these scales.
Here's a brief description of the three major temperature scales:
Celsius (°C): Also known as centigrade, the Celsius scale is based on the freezing point of water at 0°C and the boiling point of water at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure. It is widely used in most countries as the standard unit for measuring temperatures in daily life.
Fahrenheit (°F): The Fahrenheit scale is commonly used in the United States and a few other countries. It is based on the freezing point of water at 32°F and the boiling point at 212°F at standard atmospheric pressure. The Fahrenheit scale has smaller degree increments compared to Celsius.
Kelvin (K): The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale commonly used in scientific contexts. It starts from absolute zero, which is considered the lowest possible temperature at 0 Kelvin. The Kelvin scale is used in scientific research, particularly in physics and chemistry.
